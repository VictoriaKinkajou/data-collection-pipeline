# Data Collection Pipeline
An implementation of an industry grade data collection pipeline that runs scalably in the cloud. 

## Milestones 1-3
I chose to scrape data for french red wine at Ocado, as this is a search I often perform and I am familiar with the site.
I have used Selenium Webdriver as my selected website includes Javascript.
The Scraper class opens the chosen website, maximises the browser and compiles a list of all product page URLs, scrolling down the page to reveal all the results.
